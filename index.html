						<h3>
							<u>Primary Structure</u>
						</h3>
						<p>The unique sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure. This is determined by the gene
							(DNA) that encodes it. Polypeptide bonds link each amino acid.</p>
						<img src="images/PrimaryStructure.PNG" alt="Amino Acid Chain">
						<h3>
							<u>Secondary Structure</u>
						</h3>
						<p>Secondary structure is the result of the local foldings of the polypeptide. There are two types of folding α-helix (coiled like structure) and β-sheet (sheet like) which is connected by hydrogen bonds. 
						The α-helix and β-pleated sheet are secondary structures of proteins that form because of hydrogen bonding between
							carbonyl and amino groups in the peptide backbone. Entirely depends on primary structure's nature of R-groups.</p>
						<img src="images/SecondaryStructure.PNG" alt="Secondary">
						<h3>
							<u>Tertiary Structure</u>
						</h3>
						<p>Tertiary structure is due to the chemical bonds on the polypeptide chain. It is primarily due to the R groups on each
							of the amino acids which counteracts the hydrogen bonds in the secondary structure. These interactions are listed
							below: </p>
						<p>Covalent Bonds: The only covalent bounds in protien folding are disulfide linkages </p>
						<p>Ionic Bonds: Found between R groups whoose charges attract or repeal each other. </p>
						<p>Hydrophobic: Found in polar side chains, usally in the interior of the protien structures. Ex: OH, SH, COO-, NH3+ </p>
						<p>Hydrophilic: Found in non-polar side chains, usally in the exterior of the protien structures. Ex: CH3 </p>
						<p>Van der Waals Forces: Found between closely packed molecules </p>
						<img src="images/TertiaryStructure.PNG" alt="Tertiary">
						<p>Above image shows all bonds involved in tertiary structure</p>

						<h3>
							<u>Quaternary Structure</u>
						</h3>
						<p> Quaternary structure is found in protiens formed from several polypeptides called subunits. Quaternary structure exhibits
							all the same bonds and interactions as tertiary structure between different subunits. Examples of protiens with quaternary
							structure include RuBisCo, ATP Synthase, and Hemoglobin.</p>
						<img src="images/QuaterneryStructure.PNG" alt="Quaternary">
						<h4>
							<u>Protein Denaturation & Renaturation</u>
						</h4>
						<p>
							<span class="image right">
								<img src="images/Denaturation.PNG" alt="Denaturation" />
							</span> Denaturation occurs when a protien is subjected to a changes in temperature, ph, salt concentration, or ion
							concentation, its protien structure may change shape while maintaining primary structure. Ph will affect the H+ and
							OH- concentrations which will affect the strength of H and ionic bonds. High enough temperatures can break all kind
							of bonds. Finnally the salt or ion concentration changes will affect ionic and hydrogen bonds. </p>
						<p> Denaturation is often reversible as the primary structure of the protiens is left unchanged. If the cause the the denaturation
							is removed, the protien will go through renaturation and gain its original shape back.</p>

					<h2>Case Study: Amyloid fibrils</h2>

					Amyloids are a fibrous deposit that can found in organs and tissues. Two core properties of amyloids are that they are insoluble
					and almost entirely composed of of Beta-sheets. The most notable thing about amyloids is that they are heavily associated
					with diseases, such as Alzheimer's and type II diabetes. Given there association with severe neurodegenerative diseases,
					amyloids are currently a popular area of research.
					<span class="image center">
						<img src="images/table_disease.png" alt="" />The above table lists some of the diseases associated with amyloids. Note the severity of each one!</span>

				<h3>Recent Applications of Amyloids</h3>
				<p>It turns out that amyloids aren't all doom and gloom. Recent research has shown their bionanotechnological applications.
					Specifically, amyloid fibril has been experimented with use as nanotubular scaffolding. Considering the strength of
					the fibrils, they can be used for nanowires. As the source article states, "Nanowires have been fabricated by assembling
					proteins such as the N-terminal region of the yeast prion, Sup35." The results of this work are shown in the image

							Nanogold was covalently linked to the engineered cysteine residues in the protein and conjugate colloidal gold and
							silver particles were associated along the fibers to form wires,80 (B) assembly of diphenylalanine to form nanotubes
							that can be filled with silver to make nanowires.82</span>
